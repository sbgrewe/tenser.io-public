Provided here are a few examples of quick tools which made up some of the workflow for data collection, data cleaning, and data entry.

Data collection:
    Web scraping using the bs4 python module.

Data cleaning:
    Parsing and trimming of HTML plain text using bs4 and regex. Organizing data into hashes which were inserted into a larger hash to be exported to JSON.

Data entry:
    Automatic entry of JSON data into a sqlite3 database (deprecated, moved to MYSQL recently.)
